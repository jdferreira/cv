\subsubsection{Open Software}

\entry
  [2015]
  [URL: \url{http://github.com/jdferreira/owltosql}]
  {OWLtoSQL}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This software is one of the results of my PhD work. It is used to \textbf{convert an ontology written in OWL} (Web Ontology Language) \textbf{into a relational database}, which offers several advantages, the most prominent of which is that it enables \emph{random} access to the ontology constituents (classes, properties, axioms, \emph{etc.}). It has been used by Bruno Inácio in his M.Sc work (see Section~\ref{sub:academic-supervision}).
\end{itemize}


\entry
    [2015]
    [URL: \url{http://github.com/jdferreira/mossy.bak}]
    {Multi-domain Ontology-based Semantic Similarity (MOSSy)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This software also resulted from my PhD work. It is responsible for calculating \textbf{semantic similarity between resources annotated with concepts from multiple ontologies}. The program is configurable to use any OWL ontology and can handle any type of annotated resource, both in single- and multi-domain contexts. It is extensible, since it allows the implementation of semantic similarity measures as Python classes.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Knowledge representation artefacts}

\entry
    [2013]
    [See my paper \autocite{Ferreira2012a}]
    {Network of Epidemiology-Related Ontologies}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This work is a \textbf{collection of ontologies related to the epidemiology domain}. It contains 13 ontologies, from domains such as biochemistry, diseases, environment, transmission, vaccines, and geography, which provide the necessary concepts to annotate a digital resource of the epidemiological domain. The network was later included in the Epimarketplace, a repository of epidemic resources, in order to facilitate the annotation process.
    \item \textbf{Developed}: during my work in the EPIWORK project.
\end{itemize}

\entry
    [2014]
    [URL: \url{https://code.google.com/p/epidemiology-ontology/}]
    {Epidemiology Ontology}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This ontology represents both \textbf{disease transmission methods and epidemiology parameters}, containing over 300 concepts. This ontology fills the previously existing gap~in these areas, which were under-represented in biomedical ontologies. It supports the semantic annotation of resources.
    \item \textbf{Developed}: during my work in the EPIWORK project.
\end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Funding}: FCT (84$\;$000€)
    \item \textbf{Grant}: PTDC/EIA-EIA/119119/2010
    \item \textbf{Description of project}: The SOMER project aimed to develop ontology matching methods that exploit external knowledge resources through evidence and information content provided by unstructured text and annotation corpora. The results were applied to real world applications based on existing ontologies in the biomedical and geospatial areas.
    \item \textbf{My contributions}: I was involved in writing the proposal for this project. I was also responsible for exploring ways that allowed the use of semantic similarity measures in the process of ontology matching. I contributed to 1 peer-reviewed publication.
\end{itemize}

\entry
    [2009-2013]
    [URL: \url{http://xldb.di.fc.ul.pt/wiki/EPIWork}]
    {Developing the Framework for an Epidemic Forecast Infrastructure (EPIWORK)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Position}: Hired researcher
    \item \textbf{Funding}: FP7 (5$\;$000$\;$000€)
    \item \textbf{Grant}: 231807
    \item \textbf{Description of project}: The EPIWORK project proposed a framework of tools and knowledge for the design of epidemic forecast infrastructures, including: development of the mathematical and computational methods needed to achieve prediction of disease spreading in complex social systems; development of large scale, data driven computational models aimed at epidemic scenario forecast; design and implementation of data-collection mechanisms, such as the collection of real-time disease incidence, through innovative web and ICT applications; and the implementation of a computational platform for epidemic research and data sharing.
    \item \textbf{My contributions}: The LASIGE team was responsible for the creation go the Epidemic Marketplace, an online platform for epidemic research and data sharing was the data-hub for the multiple research communities and countries involved in the project. I was hired by the LASIGE team as a consultant in semantic web, specifically to design the semantic metadata model that was used to annotate the resources of the marketplace, as well as to design the Network of Epidemiology-Related Ontologies, which contributed to the repository as a collection of concepts used to annotate the resources. I contributed to 5 peer-reviewed publications and 1 open-source ontology.

\entry
    [2010]
    {Geographic Reasoning for Search Engines II (GREASE-II)}

    \item \textbf{Position}: M.Sc fellowship
    \item \textbf{Funding}: FCT (117$\;$300 €)
    \item \textbf{Grant}: PTDC/EIA/73614/2006
    \item \textbf{Description of project}: This project aimed at researching information access methods to large collections of documents and objects having geographically rich text and meta-data. One of the main ideas of the project was that geospatial information can be mapped into ontology concepts.
    \item \textbf{My contributions}: One of the tasks of this project was to perform text-mining directly onto news reports in order to find geographical references in text; to assist in this task, a disambiguation module had to be created. I was assigned the creation of software to help disambiguate annotations manually, which would then later be used in a machine-learning step. I was also tasked with the alignment of Geo-Net-PT (a geographical ontology of the Portuguese territory) to Yahoo! GeoPlanet™ (an infrastructure for geo-referencing data on the Internet). I contributed to 1 technical report and to 1 open-source software.
